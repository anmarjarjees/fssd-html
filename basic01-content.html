        Another empty element is the image tag: <img> or <img />
        
        image element has only one tag <img />. There is no content.
        All elements can have what are called attributes.
        If the element consists of an opening and a closing tag,
        the attributes are referred to in the opening tag.
        
        Attributes are additional properties (information) of an element.
        In our image example listed in our code below,
        you can see it uses a src attribute.
        
        We will talk about images in details,

        NOTE: 
        img has another very important attribute beside "src"
        it's called "alt" and we will explain it later
     -->
    <img src="no-image.jpg" />
    <!-- 
    src attribute:
    - the location/path for the image if needed
    - the image file name
 -->
