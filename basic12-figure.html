    <h2>Figure and Figcaption</h2>
    <!-- 
        the <figure> element contains an image-based component 
        such as an illustration, diagram, graph, table or code snippet.
        
        We use the image element to embed the image in an HTML document
        whereas we use the figure tag to semantically organize 
        the content of an image in the HTML document. 

        By placing an image file into a figure element, 
        you are telling the browser and search engines 
        that the content of the figure could be seen on its own, 
        separate from the rest of the content of the page, and still make sense.
