        the element "meta" is short for "Metadata"
        Metadata: is data that describes other data. 
        The HTML content that you see in a browser window is data. 
        But HTML can also contain metadata in its <head> element 
        that describes the stuff you see on the browser. 
        
        For example: 
        metadata can specify who wrote the document, 
        and provide a list of keywords and phrases used in the document.

        We can type this element in two different syntax:
        - The classical way to write an empty element: <meta charset="utf-8" />
        - The HTML5: <meta charset="utf-8">
     -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- 
        charset="UTF-8"
        charset="utf-8"
            
        UTF: Unicode Transformation Format 
        UTF-8 (UCS Transformation Format 8) is the World Wide Web's most common 
        character encoding. Each character is represented by one to four bytes. 

        This ensures that you can use characters from just about any human language
        in your HTML document, and they will display reliably.

    <!-- 
                beside meta for charset we have other meta:
        
                meta name="viewport"
                This meta data is used for Responsive Website (RWD: Responsive Web Design)  
                as we will see in the future lectures 
        
                All meta element are written inside the <head></head>
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- <body> element contains visible part of the webpage (the contents of our website):
images, paragraphs, headings...

So all the contents inside the body will be displayed in the browser.
