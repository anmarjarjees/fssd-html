    <h1>Working with Images</h1>
    <!-- 
            <img>: is inline element and empty element (self-closed tag) 
    
            The 3 img types (extension) for the web:
            .jpg 
            .png
            .gif
    
            NOT .psd or .bmp etc... 
    
            The img has three attributes:
            src:
            The src attribute stands for "source", 
            and it has to be included. It tells the browser where to find an image. 
            It contains the path to the image and the image file name
    
            alt: 
            is a required attribute (short for alternative)
            W3C (if missing)=> Error: An img element must have an alt attribute
            
            Two reasons for adding alt:
            - screen reader software used by visually impaired users 
              can read the alt description and provide a context for the image
            - if the image cannot be loaded alt will give us an alternative text to be displayed
    
            title:
            attribute (optional): The text appears only when we hover the mouse over the image

    <!-- 
        Notice that img is an inline element, so we can embed the image inside a paragraph! 
        img element has a width and height attribute

        - avoid reduce/change the image dimensions using the attributes: width and height:
        Reasons:
        - if the actual image width is 1000px => and you change it to width = 500
        this will not change the actual dimensions of the image, 
        which means we are loading the 1000px to be displayed as 300px!!!
        we should change the image width/height using a photo editor      

        - avoid using "width" or "height" to make our image responsive
        width or height will give an image a fixed size/dimensions

            alt="CBC Logo">
    </p>
    <!-- 
        use the file coding.jpg inside folder "images"
        using the actual width and height of the image file
     -->
    <img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="A group of programmers" width="1050" height="700">

        Hints: 
        - You can download Gimp (Free image editor) to modify your image:
        - The link: https://www.gimp.org/

        - You can check this page if you want to use some free images in your work:

    -->

    <!--
        for now we can use "align" attribute to align our images!
        but then we should use CSS to style the image and never use align there are also two more attributes that we should not use: width: height:

        align can have the following values: 
        - left 
        - right 
        - middle
        
        W3C: Error: The align attribute on the img element is obsolete. 

        Let's make it a hyperlink "Absolute Link"
