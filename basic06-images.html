    <h1>Working with Images</h1>
    <!-- 
            <img>: is inline element and empty element (self-closed tag) 
    
            The 3 img types (extension) for the web:
            .jpg 
            .png
            .gif
    
            NOT .psd or .bmp etc... 
    
            The img has three attributes:
            src:
            The src attribute stands for "source", 
            and it has to be included. It tells the browser where to find an image. 
            It contains the path to the image and the image file name
    
            alt: 
            is a required attribute (short for alternative)
            W3C (if missing)=> Error: An img element must have an alt attribute
            
            Two reasons for adding alt:
            - screen reader software used by visually impaired users 
              can read the alt description and provide a context for the image
            - if the image cannot be loaded alt will give us an alternative text to be displayed
    
            title:
            attribute (optional):
        -->

    <img src="code-01.png" alt="Code Institute Logo" title="The company logo">
    <!-- 
        Notice that img is an inline element, so we can embed the image inside a paragraph! 
        img element has a width and height attribute

        - avoid reduce/change the image dimensions using the attributes: width and height:
        Reasons:
        - if the actual image width is 1000px => and you change it to width = 500
        this will not change the actual dimensions of the image, 
        which means we are loading the 1000px to be displayed as 300px!!!
        we should change the image width/height using a photo editor      

        - avoid using width or height to make our image responsive
