    <!-- 
        HTML elements are usually either block-level elements or inline elements. 
        A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), 
        thereby creating a block. 

        Browsers typically display the block-level element with a new line both before 
        and after the element.

        They have a rectangular structure (like a Box that has 4 borders)

        div Element:
        The best example of a block-level element: <div></div> (division)
        It's a block-level element that defines a division on an HTML page.
        it's used to place related content inside it to provide structural context on a page.

        span Element:
        The best example of inline element: <span></span>
        It's a generic inline container for phrasing your text content.
        It's used to group elements for styling purposes.

        basic example of span
