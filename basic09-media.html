    <!-- Video and Audio -->
    <!-- 
        it's a good idea to create a div
        with an id or a class attribute 
        to contain all page content.
    
        so it will easy for us in the future 
        to center the page content using CSS 
    -->
    <div id="wrapper">
        <h2>Working with Videos</h2>
        <!-- 
            .mp4 is the new format for internet videos
            - used by YouTube
            - used by Flash Players
            - supported by HTML5

            using <video> element to insert the video
            NOTE: video is an inline element

            You can read more: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp

            IE (Edge), Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera
            can support the MP4 video format

            Besides .mp4 we have the other video formats which are: 
            - WebM: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge
            - Ogg: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge

            Note that:
            - "IE" and "Safari" don't support .Ogg
            - "IE" doesn't WebM also 
            ---------------------------------------------------------
            <video> is NOT an empty element => it has start/end tags
            all video's elements will be as attributes in the opening tag
            attName="attValue"
            in HTML5 some attributes don't have values because their name
            is descriptive and they can only do one thing:

            so instead of typing: autoplay="autoplay" as we usually do
            we can just type autoplay

            We and add width and height if needed
             -->

        <video src="media/puppy.mp4" autoplay muted controls loop poster="images/puppy.jpg" width="800">
            <!-- 
                            if the browser is very old (IE 8) and doesn't support the new HTML5 video element 
                            the following text will appear 
            -->
            <p>Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element</p>
        </video>
        <hr>
        <!-- 
            The other way of loading a video file is using the format sources,
            This way is useful when we have multiple format of the same video 
            so if you want to load more than one format 
            we need to use the source element with src attribute in w3 schools website: 
            we can apply the same attributes exactly as the top video element 
        -->
        <video autoplay muted>
            <!-- the format that is supported by the browser will be loaded: -->
            <source src="media/puppy.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="media/puppy.WebM" type="video/WebM">
            <source src="media/puppy.ogg" type="video/ogg">
            <!-- 
                if the browser is very old (IE 8) and doesn't support the new HTML5 video element 
                the following text will appear

            <p>Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element</p>
        </video>
        <hr>
        <!-- 
            Same rules for <video> element are applied for <audio> element
            The three supported audio formats:
            - mp3: used by all browsers
            - wav: all browsers except IE
            - ogg: Chrome, Firefox, and Opera (except IE and Safari)
