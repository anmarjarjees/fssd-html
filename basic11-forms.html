    <h2>Welcome to HTML form</h2>
    <!-- 
    Review:
    We have two attributes to name/label any element:
    - id
    - class 
    ================================================
    id:
    - id value cannot be duplicated (unique) in the same page
    - The symbol for id is #
    - This symbol is used with links and CSS
    - # is the id symbol (we used this symbol # with hyperlinks and will be used in CSS)

    class:
    - class value can be used one as many times we need
    - the symbol for class is .
    - this symbol is used with CSS
    - . is the class symbol (the dot symbol will be used in CSS)
    -->

    <!-- 
        div wrapper will be the main div to contain our entire code (HTML elements)

        div#wrapper ==> a div element that has id="wrapper"
        div.wrapper ==> a div element that has class="wrapper"

        Our div with class value of "wrapper"
        <div class="wrapper">
        </div>
     -->
    <div class="wrapper">

                We can use any block-level element to display the form fields in vertical way:

                - p
                - ul and li
                - br

                We will use the div block-level element for now to make each form element take one line by itself

                    <!--

                    id="first-name":
                    - to connect it with its label using for attribute
                    - can be used to give this input element a unique style (using CSS)
                    - can be used with JS or jQuery to target this element

                    to get the value of this field, so every input field must have the name attribute
                    - can be used by CSS to style this element
                    - can be used by JS to target this element

                    we can use required = "required" for the old versions
                    or we can just use required for HTML5

                    the classical way: required="required"
                    OR:
                    the new HTML5 way: required
                    
                    maxlength ==> maximum number of characters

                    we will use size="30" to change the input field width.
                    instead of using size attribute we need to use CSS, 
                    size="30" is an OLD WAY (but still valid),
                    we will use CSS to style the width (better)

                    <!-- 
                    But we can also place the input element to be a child of its label element
                        and we don't have to use for attribute 
                -->
                    <label>Last Name:*<br>
                        <!-- 
                        Below we used  id="last-name" in case to be used with CSS or JS
                        You can use the value attribute for default input values => value="Simpsons" 
                    -->
                        <input type="text" id="last-name" required maxlength="30" size="30">
                    </label>
                </div>
                <!-- 
                Before HTML5 we used to have only: type="text" 
                and it's still valid (no errors in validation)
    
                HTML5:
                type="text" is the default one (the classical type)
                Notice that all the below new listed attributes belong to HTML5:
                type="email" ==> to write an email address
                type="url" ==> to write a website address
                type="tel" ==> to write a telephone number
                type="date" ==> to write/insert the date (Calendar Icon)
                type="number" ==> to put numbers only (Positive or negative)
    
                But with HTML5 we should use type="email" for these two main reasons:
                - To have an email validation automatically and instantly (has to have @ and the . symbols)
                - For the mobile users, so the keypad will be changed to show them the @ and .com for example  
    
                All the above new types work only with the modern and updated browsers that support HTML5. If the user opening a website with an old version browser (doesnâ€™t support HTML5) they will be simply changed to type="text" as it used to be before HTML5

                        the pattern must be anyText@anyText.anyText
        
                        With HTML5, we can also add the new attribute placeholder

                        OR just:

                        in order for example "PHP/Python developers" to get the user values we use:

                        to be treated as a group.

                            if checkboxes are completely unrelated, then you can just deal with them all separately,
                            by giving each checkbox input a unique value for its "name" attribute.
    
                            if the checkboxes are all related so we should use the same value for all the "name" attributes 
                            these values of the checked (selected) checkbox inputs will be sent to the server as a group of values
                            Back-end programmers can deal with it as list (array)

                            This is a another example of using checkbox input type => with p and labels for each input
                            Using <label> element is important for two reasons:
                            ***************************************************
                            1- The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, 
                            the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.
                            2- The <label> element also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions
                            (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) especially on small screens,
                            when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.
    
                            NOTE: We should always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices
